# 🛡️ Security, Ethics & Privacy Protocol
**Policy Version 2.0**

> 📘 **Note**: This document outlines the constraints hardcoded into the system to prevent misuse.

---

## 1. Safety Guardrails (`app/agents/orchestrator.py`)
Sentinel is an **offensive** tool, but it operates within strict defensive boundaries.

### The "No-Harms" Policy
Every output generated by the LLM is passed through `Llama-Guard-3`.
- **Toxic Content**: BLOCK (Fallback to generic "I don't understand").
- **Illegal Solicitation**: BLOCK (The bot will never *ask* for illegal items).
- **Self-Harm**: BLOCK.

### 2. Privacy & PII Handling
The system is designed to trap data, but it handles it responsibly.
- **Legitimate Users**: No PII is stored. Session data is ephemeral for non-threats.
- **Threat Actors**: Data is extracted but kept within the local `data/` volume.
- **Masking**: All public logs mask phone numbers (`99******00`) and UPI IDs (`s***@ybl`).

## 3. Simulation vs. Reality
To ensure compliance with Indian Law (IT Act 2000), certain "Offensive" actions are **Simulated Only**.

| Action | Status | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Engage Scammer** | **REAL** | The bot actually replies to WhatsApp/Telegram messages. |
| **Extract Intel** | **REAL** | The bot actually parses UPI IDs/Banks. |
| **Hack Back** | **DISABLED** | The System DOES NOT attempt to exploit the scammer's device. |
| **Freeze Bank** | **SIMULATED** | The "Bank API" print logs but sends no real requests. |
| **File FIR** | **SIMULATED** | The "Police API" generates a JSON report but does not email it. |

---

## 4. Data Sovereignty
- **Location**: All processing happens locally or on compliant cloud endpoints.
- **Retention**: Data is auto-purged after 48 hours unless flagged "CRITICAL".
